    "        4. *Aggregate*:\n",
    "          - If the feature is categorical, group ⁠ df1 ⁠ by ⁠ KEY ⁠ and that feature, sum or count as appropriate, pivot to one‑row‑per‑⁠ KEY ⁠ with proportions for each category.\n",
    "          - If it’s numeric, compute the mean (or other summary) per ⁠ KEY ⁠.\n",

    "        6. If necessary given the request, *Merge* the two aggregated tables on ⁠ KEY ⁠, dropping rows where either side is missing.\n",
    "            - for example, if the merge is between df_pendolarismo and df_accesso, merge on administration.\n",
